                    <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind.
                        Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the
                        avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
                        turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
                        only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said
                        we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
                        lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

                    <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot.
                        Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that
                        one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked
                        and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of
                        the ones that became nothing.</p>
